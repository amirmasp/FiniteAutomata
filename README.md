# Deterministic Finite Automata (DFS)
DFSs are very simple abstract models of machines. Although they are simple but they could demonstrate some strong aspect of machines like doing Parallel Tasks
## atmv1: is a deterministic finite automaton pattern recognition tasks.

### Language of atmv1:
`A = {w| w contains substring 11}`
